# Bridge Inspection Simulator (STACS)

The ECSL is colaborating with the ARA Laboratory on Inspecting and Preserving Infrastructure through Robotic Exploration also known as INSPIRE. Our role is to use our expertise with development in the Unity 3d game environment to create a robotic bridge inspection simulator. We will build a series of Simulation Training And Control Systems known as (STACS) that will be used for operator training and will aid in the development of educational games that will promote robotic inspection careers.
